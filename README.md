## Overview

DJICOT is a specialized Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) tool designed for public safety operations. It provides real-time detection, tracking, and identification of DJI drones through passive RF monitoring of OcuSync Drone ID transmissions. The system integrates directly into the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem, enabling seamless integration with existing command and control infrastructure for enhanced situational awareness and threat assessment.

## Key Capabilities

- **Passive RF Detection**: Real-time drone detection and geolocation using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment
- **Target Identification**: Decodes DJI OcuSync Drone ID for positive identification and serial number extraction
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Native TAK ecosystem support for C2 systems and common operating picture displays
- **Operational Intelligence**: Displays drone, operator (GCS), and home point positions with flight vectors including speed, heading, and altitude
- **Dual-Band Coverage**: Monitors both 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz frequency bands
- **Extended Range**: Detection capability exceeding 2 miles for enhanced perimeter security
- **Rapid Deployment**: Purpose-built for quick integration into existing C-UAS processing chains
- **Electronic Support Measures (ESM)**: Employs passive RF collection methods for covert operations
